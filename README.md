# Algol60.js

Buggy, half-written version of the Algorithmic Language Algol 60.

I wanted to learn Algol, as it is the ancestor of so many great programming languages.

But I'm lazy.

So instead of finding a working implementation, I started implementing it based on the [Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language Algol 60](http://www.masswerk.at/algol60/report.htm).

For educational purposes, enjoy!

Pull requests with sample Algol code or bug fixes welcome.
